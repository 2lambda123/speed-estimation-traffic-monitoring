# HPI for Porsche

## Current Idea L&M:
1) Use PreProcessing: Take AVERAGE Pixel Per Meters from the first 5 cars tracked
2) Estimate FPS (still super buggy)
3) Track Cars with Yolo Model and calculate how many pixels the moved on the segment
4) Use Time + PPM + FPS + Moved_Pixels to caluclate Speed of Cars
5) Take average and put this out over maybe a 30 second window
