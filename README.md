# porsche_digital_hpi

## *Objective*: Using real-time video footage from traffic cameras, estimate the speed at which a Porsche might be able to travel there right now.

### Milestone 1 (Exploration)
Understand data and traffic control 
Understand how to estimate performance, agree on ground truth
Read paper and publications
Get baseline from other projects
Basic (prototype) pipeline in Jupyter Notebook 


### Milestone 2 (Building)
Agree on model architecture
Building application prototype (Python)
Accuracy benchmark: speed per direction ± 10km/h performance of model
Within performance boundaries, model efficiency more important than performance
Solution with minimum maintenance


### Milestone 3 (Fine Tuning)
Complicated situations
Create application “package” & open-source it
Visualisation of Model Predictions
Outlook: low frame rate, static images
